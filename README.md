# Password Manager

Description: A program that can create/store passwords that you use in your daily life, such as your bank passwords, facebook password, etc.
Tired of keeping track of tons of different passwords? With this program, you only have to keep track of one password: the one for this program.
All of your other passwords will be securely encrypted and stored in this program.
Once you login, you can view your passwords or copy them directly to your clipboard to paste them wherever they're needed.


# Prerequisites:

You must have Python installed on your machine to run this program. This program was created in Python version 3.7.2, and I cannot guarantee it will work on other versions of Python.
It will likely work on other versions of Python 3, but not Python 2.

You must have the pyperclip library installed for this program to work. To install this, make sure pip is intalled and simply type the following commands on the command line:

*pip install pyperclip*

This should install the library that the program uses.


# Running the program:

Download the .zip file from github and extract everything into a directory. To run the program, run the main.py file.
To do this from the command line, navigate to the directory in question and use the follow command:

*python main.py*

This should run the program. Everything in the program should be self-explanatory. Enjoy!


# Disclaimer:

I accept no responsibility for loss of any passwords for using this program. I strongly recommend you keep backups of your passwords for the worst case scenario.

**Make sure you write down the password you create for this program!**

If you forget your password, there is no recovering it, which means any stored passwords in this program will become inaccessible. Be careful!
